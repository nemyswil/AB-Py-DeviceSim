# AB-Py-DeviceSim
Python programs for intergration with Allen Bradley logix PLC
# üß™ PLC Valve Simulation Engine

This Python-based simulation engine mimics industrial valve behavior by interacting with a Rockwell PLC using `pylogix`. It simulates open/close commands and updates feedback tags accordingly.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Reads valve definitions from an Excel spreadsheet (`devices.xlsm`)
- Simulates open/close valve behavior with feedback signals
- Communicates with Allen-Bradley PLCs using Ethernet/IP
- Realistic delays and threading support
- Bit-level digital I/O writing using `SINT` manipulation
- Easy-to-use and extend

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### üßµ Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv SimVenv
   SimVenv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the simulation:

python main.py
üñ±Ô∏è Option 2: One-Click Setup (Windows)
Double-click setup_env.bat in File Explorer. It will:

Create the virtual environment

Activate it

Install all dependencies

Launch the simulation

üìä Spreadsheet Format (devices.xlsm)
Your spreadsheet must have these column headers (case-sensitive):

Tag Name	DESCRIPTION	PLCIO Tags
XV6070	open	RC4A0416:14:O.6
XV6070	open feedback	RC4A0416:6:I.0
XV6070	closed feedback	RC4A0416:6:I.1

Each valve should have at least:

An open command

An open feedback

A closed feedback

Incomplete valve definitions are skipped with a warning.

‚úÖ Example Console Output

Loaded 21 valves. Starting simulation...
Running simulation... |
XV6070: Open command detected.
XV6070: Opened - Feedback updated.

üì¶ Regenerating requirements.txt

If you add new packages:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

####üü® Notes:
This batch file assumes you have Python installed and on your PATH.

If you run into issues with Excel files, make sure openpyxl is installed and devices.xlsm is in the same directory.
